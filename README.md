# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Recipe Finder Application

This project is designed to help users like **Taylor**, a busy professional, easily find recipes based on their available ingredients, cooking preferences, and time constraints. The application uses **TheMealDB API** to suggest recipes that match the user's needs, making it easier to plan meals and cook delicious dishes with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Search Recipes by Ingredients**: Users can search for recipes by entering the ingredients they have available at home. The app will suggest recipes that can be made with those ingredients.
- **Mood-Based Search**: Based on what the user feels like eating, the app can suggest different types of meals (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, dessert).
- **Time-Based Search**: Users can input the time they have for cooking, and the app will suggest quick meals or recipes that fit within the time constraint.
- **Exclusion of Ingredients**: The app allows users to filter out certain ingredients they do not want to include in their recipes, catering to dietary preferences or restrictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (optional, if required for API handling)
- **API**: TheMealDB API - A free API providing information about meals and recipes based on ingredients.
- **Styling**: Styled-components (for React component styling)

The app will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Enter Ingredients**: Type in the ingredients you have (e.g., chicken, tomatoes, etc.) and click the search button to view relevant recipes.
- **Filter by Mood**: Use mood-based filters like "Vegetarian", "Dessert", or "Quick" to narrow down recipe suggestions.
- **Exclude Ingredients**: If there are ingredients you do not want to use, you can filter them out of the results.
- **Set Cooking Time**: Specify how much time you have, and the app will suggest recipes that can be made in that time frame.

## API Reference

The app uses **TheMealDB API** for fetching meal data. Here's the API endpoint you will interact with:

### Endpoint: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient}`

Replace `{ingredient}` with the ingredient you want to search for (e.g., `chicken`, `tomato`, `beef`).

## Future Enhancements
